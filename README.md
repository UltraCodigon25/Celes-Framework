# Sudoku-Framework
A new, feature-rich R.W.D(Responsive Web Design) C.S.S. Framework completely open-source and user-friendly. This framework is devoted to allowing extensive customization in the world of web design without hindering the user's experience and enjoyment by causing confusion and error in more complicated projects due to the large amount of code that would normally be required. Thus, this framework replaces the normally large blocks of code required to create a heavily customized element with a few lines or so to create the same effect. This will allow for an easier user experience, less time spent creating a heavily customized element, error-checking/debugging, and a smoother project pace that allows one to focus more on their sought-after goal than errors in their code.(A work in progress)
